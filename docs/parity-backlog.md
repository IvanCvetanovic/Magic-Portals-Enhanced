# Magic Portals parity — backlog

State at 2026-09-16 (first written 2026-09-15). What remains to make the **Supersonic port** (`Desktop/Supersonic-Engine/games/magicportals`)
match the original, in the order it should be done. Every spec named here lives under
`Magic-Portals-Remake/out/parity/specs/` (gitignored, local only — re-creatable from the reference library).

How to work on any item: `docs/parity.md` (rig, captures), `tools/parity/` (emu, capture_original, capture_screens,
markers, locate, compare, frames, port_build.bat). Port captures: Bash only,
`build/games/magicportals/MagicPortals.exe --level <name> --window 1280x720 --fixed-step --frames N --screenshot <png>`.
Windows Smart App Control sometimes blocks a freshly linked exe ("Not Run" / "Permission denied" / "An Application Control
policy has blocked this file"): delete the exe and relink. Touching the source is not enough when the rebuild produces the
same bytes. **Every blocked launch shows Ivan a Windows notification: never loop relink/ctest retries** — run the
suites a change touches once each, and report what stayed blocked.

## 0. Housekeeping left from this session

- [x] Merge branch `ui2-screens` into `main` — done 2026-09-16 (e6a3cca, pushed): its steps became 50-54, ctest 118/118,
      the worktree and branch removed. See the planning doc's step 54 merge note.
- [ ] Planning doc Step 45 (G3) still reports pre-amendment verdicts; add a note citing `design_port.md` §10 (gate
      amendments) and relabel the two attribution rows as the gates.
- [ ] `test_mp_launchers`: add a refusal case for a missing/bad throwable emissive.
- [ ] `test_jobs` is timing-flaky (failed on thread distribution on 2026-09-15 and again under load on 2026-09-16) —
      unrelated, but make it robust.
- [ ] GCC build never run for any of this session's work — run it once (the repo claims zero warnings on both).
- [x] MPR `DEVLOG.md`: entries for 2026-09-15 and 2026-09-16 appended.
- [ ] MPR `docs/permission.md` is still the unfilled stub — Ivan to paste the grant.
- [ ] MPR converter low items: `_i()` should parse `int(float(raw))` (TinyXML `%d` reads "1.000000" as 1);
      the CLI lighting report is not asserted by a test.
- [ ] Godot runtime in MPR (`game/scripts`, `project.godot`) is no longer the target. Ivan allowed deleting it, but the
      port still reads MPR `game/data/*.json` and the converter's `out/` — move those (or re-point the port) first.

## 1. Lighting (design: `lighting/design_port.md`, gates amended in its §10)

Done and pushed: G1 reader, E0 descriptor sets, E1 scene encoding, G2 display-encoded scene, G3 ambient/emissive,
E2 overlay map, G4 lightmaps (1-01 mean_abs vs original 29.7 → 15.9), E3 2D point lights (step 48), G5 lights placed,
the player and the shot lit, halos drawn (step 49; 1-01 15.86 → 12.72), G6 the 5/6/5 surface and the runtime bake
after a torch is lit (step 55; 4-22 noLM_E<1 vs original 0.95 → 0.13). The design's plan is complete.

- [ ] G6 leftovers: the screen overlay (HUD, pause, menus) is not quantised; the torch light's z is a `_guess`;
      `light_from_projectile.ent`'s own sprite and flame are not built; no capture of 4-22 lit (footage L1 missing).
- [ ] **G5's missed gates** (step 49, never independently verified — the session that built it died before its verify):
      1-09 `LM_E<1_halo` 6.17 against ≤ 6.0 (no single halo scale passes both LM_E<1 rows with 1x art); the orange R−B
      excess beside the 1-01 torch at 60/90/150 u is 47/18/18 below the original (asked ±15); "red rises monotonically"
      fails at one frame where the formula's prediction dips too (a gate-definition question).
      `lighting.json halo_brightness_scale` 0.6 is a `_guess` tuned to one frame's flame.

Open after the plan (design §8):
- [ ] **Script-driven emissive** — the largest remaining lighting error in chapters 2-4. Decode `ignore_emissive`,
      `door_emissive`, the crate callbacks, the player spawn and three background functions with `tools/asbc`.
- [ ] **Camera at 1-13**: port offset (0,−10) px against the original; the lighting gate refuses this level until fixed.
- [ ] Halo magnitude: formula × particle ratio; the fit's ×0.5 on one entity may need a `_guess` scale.
- [ ] Vertical entities (`vPixelLight`, XZ plane) not ported (10 `light_off` instances).
- [ ] Per-light 3D cull (`range + max side`) not ported; light existence by visible bucket not ported.
- [ ] Footage to record: L1 4-22 torch lit then put out (3 s each); L2 1-2 shot along a wall; L3 a W2 explosion near crates.

## 2. Entity visuals (plan: `visuals/plan_port.md`, ranked)

- [ ] **Step 0** — engine `--screenshot-every N` (every temporal check depends on it).
- [ ] System 1 colour transfer — largely done by lighting E1/G2; re-check its remaining rows.
- [ ] **System 2 particles**: emitter origin at the entity position (torch flame 13.4 u too low), spin sign
      (counter-clockwise ~108°/s), alpha, depth (particles 2.5 layers in front of their sprite), square quads,
      following moving owners; AM_MODULATE blend (engine has alpha + additive only).
- [ ] **Step 59's two recorded particle deviations** (SE step 59, committed with them, not tuned): on 1-01's static
      portals, the ring excess r 25-45 px on 582 is 106.5 against the original's 65.6 +-25% (1.62x; 1.33x against the
      58 footage frames), and the iris core's temporal s.d. on 604 and 582 is 3.41 / 3.19 against <= 3 on 51 frames
      (before the step 8.1 / 9.9 on 6). Both are the rings' brightness over their life (the original's pulse s.d. peaks at
      49-57 px, the port's rings alone at 23-33 px); tint, 0.8 scale, inline systems and the shipped AM_ADD blend
      (`libApplication.so` `SetAlphaMode` at 0x11eac0: `glBlendFunc(GL_ONE, GL_ONE)`) are ruled out. Next: root-cause
      the rings' life-versus-brightness curve against footage (`out/parity/visuals/particles/verify3/measure_v3.txt`).
- [ ] **System 3 player**: start frame 8 (facing right; `startFrame` is a dead field), walk 10.8 fps, space-suit sheet on
      the 19 zero-g levels, eye glow; 2.8 u rest-height difference is a body/collider question. (SE step 62, order 1.1:
      frame 8, the decoded 90 ms stride and the column carried across a stop are built; the rest stays open.)
- [ ] **Step 62 deviation, the sweep gate** (SE step 62 committed with it; 00_order section 7 step 1.1): required normal f8
      wins in all 54 levels where the original's h6.3 f8 >= 0.85; measured 52 of 54 at f420. Misses 1-02 (best space f8
      0.7967, lead 0.004; normal f8 0.7927) and 1-03 (best space f8 0.8123, lead 0.0025; normal f8 0.8098): the
      level-start tutorial popup covers the player in the port's f420 frame, while the library's h6.3 frames of exactly
      these two were taken after the popup was closed (sidecars `popup_pages 1`; `tools/parity/capture_original.py:86-113`).
      Popup closed in the port (`--tap 1178,358@300-305`): 54 of 54, 0.894 at x 1100 and 0.903 at x 287 against the
      original's 0.906 and 0.894; popup up on both sides: 52 of 52; lowest winner 1-29 at 0.8575, lead 0.050. Next: amend
      the 00_order gate wording so 1-02 and 1-03 are captured with the popup closed, as the library did. Only those two
      chapter-1 levels, not every sweep gate; 1.2's gates are chapter 4 and unaffected.
- [ ] **Step 62 deviation, the stride's data shape**: systems_3_4 3a asked for `character.animation.frames_per_second
      11.111111`; the port stores the decoded `stride_ms 90` (`SideScrollerCharacter` ctor 9-11), rate derived as 1000 /
      stride, `idle_column 0`. Same decode, different block shape. Next: 1.2 builds its 280 ms zero-gravity column on
      `stride_ms`.
- [ ] **Step 62 deviation, the zero-gravity player**: `MainCharacter::linearMotion` runs every update only when
      `noGravity` is set (3-6) and calls `FrameTimer` `set(0,3,280,true)` (163-171). On the 18 `no_gravity` levels the
      standing player cycles columns every 280 ms, a walking update adds its time twice, and the player hovers by
      1.2*cos(a) on y; step 62's timer holds only with gravity (recorded in `art.json` `_source`). Next: step 1.2.
- [ ] **Step 62 deviation, facing a portal tap**: the original turns the player toward a portal tap and the port never
      does. `PortalManager::managePortalInsertion` #101-124 (listing L:27784) calls `setDirection(1)` if the player is
      right of the tap, else `setDirection(2)`, on an accepted request with no `projectile.ent` alive. Not a 1.1
      regression. Next: step 1.3 or a new 1.x: `m_facingRight = !(playerX > tapX)` under the sim's acceptance, pinned
      in `test_mp_layer` (a tap left of the standing level0 player gives `firstFrame` 4).
- [ ] **Step 62 deviation, evidence for the carried column**: no clip of the original resolves a column across a stop.
      F12 holds right once; F9 r7b (`F9_flyin_3-18.mp4`) walks right, stops and steps back left, but at about 17 fps
      (median gap 50 ms) it cannot resolve a 90 ms column. Carry-over rests on the decode plus the port's tick-for-tick
      stop-and-turn capture (step 62's wording corrected at commit). Next: a 60 fps stop-and-resume clip.
- [ ] **Step 62 deviation, a fragile invariant**: carry-over depends on `syncDrawables` (`MagicPortalsLayer.cpp:2611-2614`)
      writing `playing` and `frameCount` together, because `SpriteAnimationSystem::Advance` resets `frame` to 0 when a
      playing flipbook's count is 1. Cannot happen today; `TheWalkKeepsItsColumnAndItsTime` guards it on level8. Next:
      1.2 (280 ms zero-gravity column) and 1.3 (pushing rows) keep that test running, or comment the coupling, if they
      touch that block.
- [ ] **Step 83 deviation, 2-26's edge scan** (SE step 83 committed with it; 00_order §7 step 4.1,
      `work_s34/antiportal_edge.py`): required half/scale 31.5-34.0 on `antiportal_955` at node scale 3.6; measured
      **30.50** (17.08 before, so the row moved 13.4 of the 14.4 it was short). NOT MET as written. Attributed cause,
      measured on both sides and reproduced by the verifier on its own capture, its own re-implementation and both grids
      (the brief's fixed 40-70.5 u port grid and the per-scale 24s-40s grid): saturation, not size. The port's rim is
      still additive white and clips at 255 over that level's bright ground (inside-band median (255, 255, 255), 54-66 %
      of its pixels at 255 in all three channels, outside band summing 217-221), so the summed step is a plateau of 509.5
      tied at halves 30.5 / 30.75 / 31.0 / 31.25 / 31.5 / 33.25 and the estimator's strict `>` keeps the first; the
      original's same ring does not clip over 30.5-33.5 ×scale (≤ 0.5 % of the band at 255 in all three channels) and
      reads 33.25. The ring's drawn size is correct: a clipping-immune estimator reads 32.10 ×scale there against the
      original's 31.82-32.03 on six library frames, and the outermost-changed-pixel reading gives 32.06. The gate band
      also misses ground truth — 4 of the original's 30 frame readings by the same estimator fall below its own 31.5
      floor (1-10 at t2.0/t4.5/t8.0, 2-26 at h6.3). Next: step 4.2 (Blink and spin) removes the cause, because its own
      gates put c_G and c_B ≤ 0.03 so the rim stops being additive white — but 4.2's §7 gate list names only 3-12, 4-02,
      4-07 and 1-07 and contains no size re-read, so an explicit 2-26 `antiportal_955` edge-scan re-read has to be added
      to 4.2's gates (or the row's wording amended in 00_order §7: last maximum, tie midpoint, or a brightness-independent
      reading). Without that addition this NOT MET row has no owner and would silently disappear.
- [ ] System 4 antiportals: drawn 64×scale u (not a flat 128 u) — **built, SE step 83**; the red tint is still open
      (order 4.2). The refusal radius stays 16×scale in the port against the decoded **32×scale** (128 u × the manager's
      `Scale(0.5)` × the node's scale, halved; footage F3 brackets the original's refusal at (31.6, 32.4]×scale). Ruled
      R1 — what the original does — but no step in 00_order §7 plays it yet.
- [ ] **System 5 actors with sheets**: minions/knights (63 spawns in 35 levels) have no sprites; dragon draws the whole sheet.
- [ ] **System 6 texture tiers**: hd/fullhd per file (fullhd skies are 512 u wide). Converter + port together, or sprites
      draw twice too big; the Sprite offset × scale trap applies.
- [ ] System 7 spawned effect entities: teleport effects, player-placed portal spiral, pickup/explosion effects,
      `portal_fail*`, key/keyhole effects; carranca fireballs are tan placeholder boxes today.
- [x] System 8 light halos — landed in G5 (step 49); magnitude still open under §1.
- [ ] System 9 converter-carried per-placement data: scale, sprite frames, the levels' own particle systems
      (45 placements load the wrong data).
- [ ] System 10 small scripted motions: crystal bob, arrow sway (2.5 u, 1.52 s), timed-crystal fade.
- [ ] **StaticSky** (camera-pinned sky) not ported → **34 levels show black ground** (found at G2).
- [ ] Placeholder boxes draw darker since the display-encoded scene.
- [ ] Footage to record (plan §4): F1 walk left, F2 place + enter a portal, F3 failed shot / antiportal, F4 crystal bob,
      F5 knight patrol, F6 carranca fire + barrel, F7 2-32/4-32 in-level frames, F8 antiportal pulse, F9 key pickup,
      F10 zero-g recoil.
- [ ] Cannot be known from footage (needs the bytecode decode): exact red/blue portal tint (`portalColorA/B`), shot frame
      timer, which script spawns `appear_effect.ent`.

## 3. UI

- [x] HUD + level start (steps 38-40), pause / finished / game over / popups (steps 50-52).
- [x] UI3 loading screen + main menu (step 53); credits, achievements dashboard and locking (step 54). Rulings applied:
      two chapters per page, back quits, locking as the original, loading screen.
- [x] UI3 chapter select + level grid (step 56, `sim/Selector`): vs the stills 1.72-2.86 mean_abs at offset (0, 0).
- [ ] Step 56 leftovers: spec 7.5/7.6 rows needing footage (slide frame by frame vs nav_gold, arrow entrance, swipe
      paths); silver chapter medal uncaptured (U3); the page counter's dot fits worse than its digit (U4).
- [ ] Step 54 was never independently verified and its §7.3 / §7.4 acceptance rows were not each measured: only
      compare.py on two frames (credits 6.79, dashboard 2.89) and the suites. The gold-save dashboard shows 315 points
      against the original's 325 (an unlock the port's medals cannot decide).
- [ ] UI2 leftovers: finished screen counter/medal past golden+2 not captured on a real play; door suck/sparkle effect and
      death burst/skull not built; 3-09 and 4-01 popups never raised at runtime; the pause's AchievementsPopup unmeasured.
- [ ] UI3 leftovers (spec §8.3): achievement unlock conditions not decoded (`AchievementManager`); locked-tile denial;
      credits drag/fling and dashboard bottom band not recorded; silver-medal states not captured; switch actions not decoded.
- [ ] Achievement text/icons are Asantee content: only in gitignored `out/data/achievements.json`, produced by the committed
      `tools/asbc/achievements.py --listing <all_functions.txt>`; the port draws no rows without it.

## 4. Gameplay feel (MILESTONE_1 §3 — still guesses)

- [ ] Player walk speed, acceleration, gravity (player.json all `_guess`) — measurable now from footage (rec11 walk).
- [ ] Camera follow lag / hold (portals.json camera `_guess`) — measurable from rec11 (the 11.25-12.0 s scroll).
- [ ] Portal timings `FIRST_PORTAL_MIN_TIME`, `NEXT_PORTAL_MIN_TIME`, collision radius, transit — decode or frame-step.

## 5. Final check

- [ ] 128-level sweep: capture the port at the library's `_h6.3` moment for every level, compare with
      `out/parity/original/levels/`, list residual differences per level, fix upstream (converter / port), repeat.
